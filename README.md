# Pharmanager API Documentation

## Introduction

The Pharmacy Management System (PMS) API provides access to various functionalities for managing Pharmacies such as authentication, inventories, inbounds, patients records, etc. To use this API, you need to authenticate and then perform CRUD and other operations on different resources.

**Note 1:** This API was created using Node.js, Express, Prisma and other dependencies using HTTP-only cookies.

**Note 2:** Authentication is programmed in such a way that on first-time registration, a confirmation email is sent to the user's email for confirmation before being authorized to access different routes in the app.
